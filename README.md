# geo_app

This is a Python Flask application server. The purpose of this app is to illustrate how a geospatial API can be created in Flask. The geospatial API creates a buffer polygon of a given lon and lat values with buffer distance in KM. The response of the API is a GeoJSON file containing both the given point and the created buffer using the buffer distance given.


This is an example of the API endpoint for an area in Mal√©, Maldives and a buffer distance of 25 KM:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/buffer-point?lon=73.51&lat=4.17&buf-dist=25
